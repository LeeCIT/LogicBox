				<h4>About LogicBox</h4>
				<br>
				<div class="col-lg-6 col-lg-offset-3">
					LogicBox was created as a final year project in Cork Institute of Technology.
                    During our course, we encountered a logic gate simulation software called "EasySim".
                    This piece of software was extremely old and outdated. It was hard and inefficient to use.
                    Instead of acting as a learning tool, it acted as a barrier to learning. It is only compatible with
                    32 bit Windows XP! It was even missing simple, yet crucial actions such as undo/redo.
                    <p><p></p>
                        So for our final year project, we decided to create a new logic gate simulation software which
                        had a nicer interface, feature improvements, additional features and multi-platform support.
